#TODO pyppeteerSearch: Add a whaaaaaat menu
#TODO pyppeteerSearch: use map and filter in __check_contact_list and __check_group_list
#FIXME pyppeteerSearch: False positive group -> Groups name use the same div as contact status,
        so we need to verify if target name is in title, not in status. But, 
        sometimes the status contain the target name and shows up as 
        false-positive group. 
        WHERE WE CAN FIX? __checking_group_list
#pyppeteerSearch FIXME: ugly output when nobody is found


#TODO pyppeteer: Wait for the last message to be sent before closing the browser
